# Car-ML
Neural network for car on the road

Firstly need to activate kart and disable 2nd kart.
Gathering data script will get all data from user behavior and save it to txt file

Secondly disable 1st car and able 2nd car. 

Set up in script bool field to false. Coz we haven't weights yet.

Push play button. NN is learning by user data. Try to minimize SSE(sum square equal)

After that car get some weights for it and use it to drive.

P.S: perceptron can find local optima, NOT GLOBAL

So actually need more times to find global minimum and drive car naturally
